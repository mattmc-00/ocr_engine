right brain intuitive insight to achieve a complete comfortable grasp of the
concepts involved. Nevertheless, once that is done, I am confident that their
construction and application will stand up to the test of vational critique.

4, Paradoxically, having gone to such great lengths to avoid trying to render
judgements based on an occult or dogmatic frame of reference in the end I found it
necessary to return, at least briefly, to the question of the impact of the Gateway
Experience on common belief systems. I aia so because although it was essential to
avoid attempting to render an assessment in the context of such systems, I felt
that it was necessary after having completed the analysis to point out that the
resulting conclusions do not do any violence to the fundamental mainstream of
either eastern or western belief systems. Unless that point is clearly
established, the danger exists that some people will reject the whole concept of
the Gateway Experience in the mistaken belief that it contradicts and is therefore
alien to all that they hold to be right and true.

5. This study is certainly not designed to be the last word on the subject but I
hope that the validity of its basic structure and of the fundamental concepts upon
which it is based will make it a useful guide for other USAINSCOM personnel who are
vequired to take the Gateway training or work with Gateway materials.
