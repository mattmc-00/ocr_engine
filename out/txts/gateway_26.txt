37, Motivational Aspect. It is a step by step procedure which involves repetitive
practice of the techniques concerned, using each new insight as a means of
penetrating farther during the next practice session. But the rate of progress is
so much faster with the Gateway approach than it is with transcendental meditation
or other forms of mental self-discipline and its horizons seem to be so much wider
that the discipline needed to practice it would seem to be within the means of even
the impatient, result oriented, skeptical pragmatist of our society. Unlike yoga
and other forms of eastern mental discipline, Gateway does not require the infinite
patience and total personal subservience to and faith in a system of discipline
designed to absorb all the individual's energies over most of a lifetime. Rather,
it will begin to produce at least minimal results within a relatively short time
such that enough feedback is available to motivate and energize the individual to
continue working with it. Indeed, the speed with which an individual may expect to
progress seems less a function of the number of hours spent practicing than it is a
question of the speed with which he or she is able to use the insights gained to
release anxieties and stresses within both the mind and the body. These points of
energy blockage seem to provide the principal barriers to achieving the énhanced
energy states and focus of mind needed for rapid progression, The more compulsive,
the more "uptight" the individual may be at the outset the more barriers he or she
will initially encounter to achieving a deep or immediate experience, but as the
insights begin to come and the blockages begin to dissolve, the way ahead becomes
increasingly clear and the value of Gateway moves from the status of a matter of
intellectual assessment to one of personal experience.

38. Conclusion. There is a sound, rational basis in terms of physical science
parameters for considering Gateway to be plausible in terms of its essential
objectives. Intuitional insights of not only personal but of a practical and
professional nature would seem to be within bounds of reasonable expectations.
However, a phased approach for entering the Gateway Experience in an accelerated
mode would seem te be required if the time needed to reach advanced states of
altered consciousness is to be brought within more manageable limits from the
standpoint of establishing an organization-wide exploitation of Gateway's
potential. The most promising approach suggested in the foregoing study involves
the following steps:

A. Begin by using the Gateway Hemi-Sync tapes to achieve enhanced brain focus
and to induce hemisphere synchronization.

B. Then add strong REM sleep frequencies to induce left brain quiescence and
deep physical relaxation.

Cc. Provide hypnotic suggestion designed to enable an individual to induce
deep autohypnotic state at will.

D. Use autohypnotic suggestion to attain much enhanced focus of concentration
and motivation in rapidly progressing through Focus 12 exercises.

E. Then repeat steps A and B following use of the autohypnotic suggestion
that an out-of-body movement will occur and be remembered.

F. Repeat step E to achieve facility in gaining out-of-body state under
conscious control. Alter hypnotic suggestion to stress ability to consciously

control out-of-body movement and maintain it even after REM sleep state ends.

G. Approach Focus 15 and 21 objectives(escape from time-space and interact
