geometric form and in energy frequency, the consciousness perceives(see Exhibit 2,
next page). As psychologist Keith Floyd puts it:

"Contrary to what everyone knows is so, it may not be the brain that produces
consciousness--but rather, consciousness that creates the appearance of the
brain..."

15. Brain in phase: The consciousness process is most easily envisaged if we
picture the holographic input with a three dimensional grid system superimposed
over it such that all of the energy patterns contained within can be described in
terms of three dimensional geometry using mathmatics to reduce the data to two
dimensional form. Bentov states that scientists suspect that the human mind
operates on a simple binary "go/no go" system as do all digital computers.
Therefore, once it superimposes a three dimensional matrix over holographic
information it wishes to interpret and reduces that information mathmatically to
two dimensional form, it can completely process it using its fundamental binary
system just as any computer made by the hand of man can process volumes of data and
make various comparisons between the data and information stored in its digital
memory. Our minds operate in the same way, perceiving by comparison only. Bentov
states the proposition this way: "Our whole reality is constructed by constantly
making such comparisons,...Whenever we perceive something, we always perceive
differences only." In states of expanded consciousness, the right hemisphere of
the human brain in its holistic, nonlinear and nonverbal mode of functioning acts
as the primary matrix or receptor for this holographic input while, by operating in
phase or coherence with the vight brain, the left hemisphere provides the secondary
matrix through its binary, computer-like method of functioning to screen further
the data by comparison and reduce it to a discreet, two dimensional form,

16. Evaluation. To the extent that Gateway succeeds in bringing about a
refinement in energy matrix of the mind, it succeeds in expanding or altering human
consciousness so that it can perceive without recourse to the intercession of the
physical senses such that ever more of the universal hologram(not, of course,
accessible by sense perception) can ultimately be perceived and understood,

Marilyn Ferguson has written that the theories of Pribram and Bohm "appear to
account for all trans¢endental experience, paranormal events and even "normal"
perceptual oddities..." She goes on to say of Pribram:

“Currently he is proposing a startling, all-encompassing model that is
generating considerable excitement among those intrigued by the mysteries of
human consciousness. His "holographic model" marries brain research to
theoretical physics; it accounts for normal perception and simultaneously
takes the paranormal and transcendental experiences out of the supernatural by
explaining them as a part of nature.

Like certain strange discoveries of quantum physics, the radical reorientation
of this theory suddenly makes sense of paradoxical sayings of mystics
throughout the ages."

17. Self Cognition. To complete our outline of the process by which the mind
achieves and exercises consciousness, we must also describe the mechanism which
accounts for the aspect of human thought that differentiates it from the
consciousness of plants or animals, i.e. self cognition, Humans not only know, but
they know that they know. They are able to monitor the process of their own
thinking and maintain an awareness of it. Moreover, they can conduct a comparitive
