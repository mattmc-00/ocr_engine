cortex on the right side of the prain. AS a result, according to Bentov, these
waves “will stimulate and eventually ‘polarize’ the cortex in such a way that it
will tend to conduct a signal along the homunculus, starting from the toes and on
up." The Bentov bio-medical model, as described in a book by Lee Sannella, M.D.,
entitled: Kundalini-Psychosis or Transcendence, states that the standing
acoustical waves are the result of the altered rhythm of heart sounds which are
occasioned by prolonged practice of meditation, and which set up sympathetic
vibrations in the walls of the fluid filled cavities which comprise the third and
lateral ventricles of the brain. In addition, according to Bentov: "The states of
bliss described by those whose Kundalini symptoms have completed the full loop
along the hemispheres may be explained as a self-stimulation of the pleasure
centers in the brain caused by the circulation of a ‘current' along the sensory
cortex." Bentov also notes, "that most of the described symptoms start on the
left side of the body means that it is mostly a development occurring in the right
hemisphere." Although normally a period of meditation involving intense
concentration and practice for five years or some is required to “bring up the
Kundalini," Bentov states that exposure to mechanical or acoustical vibrations in
the range of 4-7 Hertz(cycles per second) for protracted periods may achieve the
same effect, Bentov cites as an example "repeated riding in a car whose suspension
and seat combination produce that range of vibrations, ox being exposed for long
periods of time to these frequencies caused, for instance, by an air conditioning
duct." He also notes that: “The cumulative effect of these vibrations may be able
to trigger a spontaneous physio-Kundalini sequence in susceptable people who have a
particularly sensitive nervous system.”

4. Biofeedback, The third consciousness altering methodology which will be
briefly described is biofeedback. Biofeedback is somewhat unique in that it
actually employs the self-cognitive powers of the left hemisphere to gain access to
such areas of the right brain as the lower cerebral, motor and sensory cortices and
assorted pain or pleasure centers. Instead of suppressing the left hemisphere as
is done in hypnosis, or largely bypassing and ignoring it as is done in
transcendental meditation, biofeedback teaches the left hemisphere first to
visualize the desired result and then to recognize the feelings associated with the
experience of successful right hemisphere access to the specific lower cerebral,
cortex, pain or pleasure or other areas in the manner needed to produce the desired
result. Special self-monitoring devices such as the digital thermometer are used
to inform the left brain when it succeeds in keying the right hemisphere into
accessing the appropriate area. Once this is done, the left brain can then
vepeatedly instruct the right brain to reestablish the pathways involved so as to
produce the same external, objective measures of success. In this way, the
pathways are strengthened and emphasized to such an extent that left brain
consciousness is enabled to access appropriate areas in the vight brain using a
conscious, demand mode. For example, if the subject wishes to increase the
circulation in the left leg in order to speed up healing he may concentrate with
his left brain on achieving that result while carefully monitoring a digital
thermometer connected to the left leg. When the concentrated effort begins to
achieve success, the digital thermometer will register an increase in the
temperature of the left leq. At that point, the subject can mentally (left brain)
associate the sensations experienced with the result achieved and can begin to
emphasize, by memory recall, the same process to cause its strengthening by
affirmation and repetition. In this way, pain can be blocked, healing can be
enhanced, malignant tumors can apparently be suppressed and ultimately destroyed,
the body's pleasure centers can be stimulated, and a variety of specific
physiological results may be achieved. In addition, biofeedback may be used to
greatly accelerate achievement of deep meditative states particularly for beginners
