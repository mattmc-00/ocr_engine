inhabit those dimensions between time-space and the Absolute. In so doing, we may
better perceive the form that “reality” assumes when we encounter it in those
intermediate dimensions, In this context, Bentov tells us that:

"“~he causal relationship between events breaks down; movements become jerky
rather than smooth. Time and space may become “grainy” or "chunky." Perhaps
a piece of space can be traversed by a particle of matter in any direction
without necessarily being synchronized with a piece of time. In short, a pair
of events will occur in either time or space, the pair not being connected
causally but by a random fluctuation."

What Bentov means is that inside the dimension of time-space where both concepts
apply in a generally uniform way there is a proportional relationship between
them. A certain space can be covered by energy moving in either particle or wave
form in a certain time assuming a specific velocity virtually anywhere in the
time-space universe. The relationship is neat and predictable. However, in the
intermediate dimensions beyond time-space the limitations imposed on energy to put
it into a state of oscillating motion are not uniform as they are in our physical
universe. A myriad of various distortions and incongruities are thus likely to be
encountered such that our nice neat assumptions concerning the relationship between
time and space as we know it in this dimension do not apply. But even more
important, access is opened to both the past and the future when the dimension of
current time-space is left behind.

22, Special Status, Out-of-Body Experience. Although human consciousness can,
with enough practice, move beyond the dimension of time-space and interface with
other energy systems in other dimensions, the entire process is appreciably
enhanced if that consciousness can be detached in large measure from the physical
body before such interface is attempted, Once an individual becomes proficient in
the technique of out-of-body movement and then reaches the point where he is able
to break out of time-space while out of his body, he gains the advantage of
“clicking out" part of his enhanced consciousness while starting from a base
located much closer to the dimensions with which he wishes to communicate. In
other words, since he is starting from a point much "higher up", to use an analogy
from the time-space context, that part of his consciousness involved in "clicking
out" will have that much more time to interact in dimensions beyond time-space
because less time is required to traverse the intervening layers. Moreover, once
the individual is able to project his consciousness beyond time-space, that
consciousness would logically tend to entrain its frequency output with the new
energy environment to which it is exposed, therein greatly enhancing the extent to
which the individual's altered consciousness may be further modified to achieve a
much heightened point of focus and a mach refined oscillating pattern. As a
result, a self-reinforcing process should ensue whereby the farther consciousness
in the out-of-body state can be projected beyond the time-space dimension, the more
its level of energy output would be enhanced, thus promoting the potential for
still further travel. The tentative conclusion to be drawn is that the out-of-body
state may be regarded as an extremely effective way of accelerating the process of
enhancing consciousness and of interfacing with dimensions beyond time-space. If
the practitioner of the Gateway technique has a choice of concentrating on
achieving and exploiting the out-of-body experience as opposed to concentrating his
full efforts on expanding his consciousness exclusively from a physical base, the
former would appear to promise much faster and more impressive successes than does
the latter.
