Laboratory demonstration of Gabor's work only occurred years later following
invention of the laser. As biologist Lyall Watson explains;

“The purest kind of light available to us is that produced by a laser, which
sends out a beam in which all the waves are of one frequency, like those made
by an ideal pebble in a perfect pond. When two laser beams touch, they produce
an interference pattern of light and dark ripples that can be recorded on a
photographic plate. And if one of the beams, instead of coming directly from
the laser, is reflected first off an object such as a human face, the resulting
pattern will be very complex indeed, but it can still be recorded, The record
will be a hologram of the face."

13. The Part Encodes the Whole, Of further importance is the fact that even if we
dropped our frozen hologram of the ripple pattern on the floor and broke it into a
number of pieces each individual piece would recreate the entire holographic image
all by itself. The smaller the piece, the fugzier and more distorted would be the
resulting holographic projection but the fact remains that a whole projection would
nonetheless be made. The key to creating any hologram is that energy in motion
must interact with energy in a state of rest(nonmotion). In the foregoing example,
the pebbles represent energy in motion while the water(before its agitation by the
pebbles) represents energy at a state of rest. To activate or, in effect, to
"perceive" the meaning of a holograph, energy(in this case, a coherent light source
such as a laser beam) must be passed through the interference pattern generated by
interaction between the moving energy and the energy at rest. In the simple
example given by Bentov, this requirement was fulfilled by holding the frozen
interference pattern in front of the coherent light to project the three
dimensional holographic image(its "meaning") into space. As Marilyn Perguson,
editor of the Brain/Mind Bulletin tells us:

“Another Feature of a hologram is its efficiency. Billions of bits of
information can be stored in a tiny space. The pattern of the holographic
[photograph] ...is stored everywhere on the plate,"

14, The Consciousness Matrix. The universe is composed of interacting energy
fields, some at rest and some in motion. It is, in and of itself, one gigantic
hologram of unbelievable complexity. According to the theories of Karl Pribram, a
neuroscientist at Stanford University and David Bohm, a physicist at the University
of London, the human mind is also a hologram which attunes itself to the universal
hologram by the medium of energy exchange thereby deducing meaning and achieving
the state which we call consciousness, With respect to states of expanded or
altered consciousness such as Gateway uses, the process operates in the following
way. AS energy passes through various aspects of the universal hologram and is
perceived by the electrostatic fields which comprise the human mind, the
holographic images being conveyed are projected upon those electrostatic fields of
the mind and are perceived or understood to the extent that the electrostatic field
is operating at a frequency and amplitude that can harmonize with and therefore
"read" the energy carrier wave pattern passing through it. Changes in the
frequency and amplitude of the electrostatic field which comprises the human mind
determines the configuration and hence the character of the holographic cnergy
matrix which the mind projects to intercept meaning directly from the holographic
transmissions of the universe. Then, to make sense of what the holographic image
is "saying" to it, the mind proceeds to compare the image just received with
itself. Specifically, it does this by comparing the image received with that part
of its own hologram which constitutes memory. By registering differences in
