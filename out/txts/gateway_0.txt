1. You tasked me to provide an assessment of the Gateway Experience in terms of
its mechanics and ultimate practicality. As I set out to fulfill that tasking it
soon became clear that in order to assess the validity and practicality of the
process I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understand
how and why the process works, frankly, sir, that proved to be an extremely
involved and difficult business. Initially, based on conversations with a
physician who took the Gateway training with me, I had recourse to the biomedical
models developed by Itzhak Bentov to obtain information goncerning the physical
aspects of the process. Then I found it necessary to delve into various sources
for information concerning quantum mechanics in order to be able to describe the
nature and functioning of human consciousness. I had to be able to construct a
scientifically valid and reasonably lucid model of how consciousness functions
under the influence of the brain hemisphere synchronization technique employed by
Gateway. Once this was done, the next step involved recourse to theoretical
physics in order to explain the character of the time-space dimension and the means
by which expanded human consciousness transcends it in achieving Gateway's
objectives. Finally, I again found it necessary to use physics to bring the whole
phenomenon of out-of-body states into the language of physical science to remove
the stigma of its occult connotations, and put it in a frame of reference suited to
objective assessment.

2. <I began the narrative by briefly profiling the fundamental biomedical factors
affecting such related techniques as hypnosis, biofeedback and transcendental
meditation so that their objectives and mode of functioning could be compared in
the reader's mind with the Gateway experience as the model of its underlying
mechanics was developed. Additionally, that introductory material is useful in
supporting the conclusions of the paper. I indicate that at times these related
techniques may provide useful entry points to accelerate movement into the Gateway
Experience,

3. Niels Bohr, the renowned physicist once responded to his son's complaints about
the obtuse nature of certain concepts in physics by saying: “You are not thinking,
you are merely being logical." The physics of altered human consciousness deals
with some conceptualizations that are not easily grasped or visualized exclusively
in the context of ordinary "Left brain" linear thinking. So, to borrow Dr. Bohr's
mode of expression, parts of this paper will require not only logic but a touch of
