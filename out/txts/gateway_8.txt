coherence at steadily higher levels of frequency and amplitude so as to entrain
analgous frequencies in the universe for data collection also promotes enhancement
of bodily energy levels to a point adequate to permit the subject to experience an
out-of-body movement when he is ready to do so(more will be said about this topic
later). In addition, by resonating with the earth's electromagnetic sphere the
human body creates a surprisingly powerful carrier wave to assist the mind in
communication activity with other human minds similarly tuned.

ll. Consciousness and Energy. Before our explanation can proceed any further, it
is essential to define the mechanism by which the human mind exercises the function
known aS consciousness, and to describe the way in which that consciousness
operates to deduce meaning from the stimuli which it receives. To do this, we will
first consider the fundamental character of the material world in which we have our
physical existence in order to accurately perceive the raw stuff with which our
consciousness must work, The first point which needs to be made is that the two
terms, matter and energy tend to be misleading if taken to indicate two distinctly
different states of existence in the physical world that we know it. Indeed, if
the term matter is taken to mean solid substance as opposed to energy which is
understood to mean a force of some sort, then the use of the former is entirely
misleading. Science now knows that both the electrons which spin in the energy
field Located around the nucleus of the atom and the nucleus itself are made up of
nothing more than oscillating energy grids. Solid matter, in the strict
construction of the term, simply does not exist. Rather, atomic structure is
composed of oscillating energy grids surrounded by other oscillating energy grids
which orbit at extraordinarily high speeds. In his book, Stalking thé Wild
Pendulum, Itzhak Bentov gives the following figures. The energy grid which
composes the nucleus of the atom vibrates at approximately 1022 Hertz(which means
10 followed by 22 zeros). At 70 degrees Farenheit an atom oscillates at the rate
of 1015 yertz., An entire molecule, composed of a number of atoms bound together

in a single energy field vibrates in the range of 10? Hertz. A live human cell
vibrates at approximately 103 Hertz. The point to be made is that the entire
human being, brain, consciousness and all is, like the universe which surrounds
him, nothing more or less than an extraordinarily complex system of energy fields.
The so called states of matter are actually variances in the state of energy, and
human consciousness is a function of the interaction of energy in two opposite
states(motion vs rest) in a manner described in the following paragraph.

12, Holograms, Energy creates, stores and retrieves meaning in the universe by
projecting or expanding at certain frequencies in a three dimensional mode that
creates a living pattern called a hologram. The concept of the hologram can be
most easily understood by using an example cited by Bentov in which he asks the
reader to visualize a bowl full of water into which three pebbles are dropped. As
the ripples created by the simultaneous entry of the three pebbles radiate outward
towards the rim of the bowl, Bentov further asks the reader to visualize that the
surface of the water is suddenly flash frozen so that the ripple pattern is
preserved instantly. The ice is removed leaving the three pebbles still laying at
the bottom of the bowl. ‘Then the ice is exposed to a powerful, coherent source of
light, such as a laser. The result will be a three dimensional model or
representation of the position of the three pebbles suspended in midair. Holograms
are capable of encoding so much detail that, for example, it is possible to take a
holographic projection of a glass of swamp water and view it under magnification to
see small organisms not visible to the naked eye when the glass of water itself is
examined. The whole concept of holography, despite its scientific implications,
has only been known to the physicist since the underlying mathmatical principles
were worked out by Dennis Gabor in 1947(he later won a Nobel Prize for his work).
