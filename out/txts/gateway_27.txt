within new dimensions) from the out-of-body perspective.

H. Use multi-focus approach to solve problem of distortion in terrestrial
information gathering trips. This approach involves the use of three individuals
in the out-of-body state, one viewing the target object here, in time-space, one
viewing it at Focus 15 as it slips into the immediate past, and one viewing it at
Focus 21 as it slips from the immediate future. Debrief all three and compare data
gathered from the three points of view. If care is taken to insure that the three
all go out-of-body together, in the same environment, their consciousness energy
systems should resonate in sympathetic oscillation, They can tune in to the same
target on different planes(dimensions) with greater effectiveness,

I. Encourage pursuit of full self knowledge by all individuals involved in
the foregoing experiments to enhance objectivity in out-of-body observation and
thinking, and to remove personal energy blockages likely to retard rapid progress.

g. Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with*
intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeded.

K. Arrange to have groups of people in Focus 12 state unite their altered
consciousness to build holographic patterns around sensitive areas to repulse
possible unwanted out-of-body presences.

L. Encourage more advanced Gateway participants to build holographic patterns
of successful attainment and rapid progress for advanced colleagues to assist them
in progressing through the Gateway system.

I£ these experiments are carried through, it is to be hoped that we will truly find

a gateway to Gateway and to the realm of practical application for the whole system
of techniques which comprise it.
