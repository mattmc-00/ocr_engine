points will eventually collide somewhere along the aorta and produce an
interference pattern," By placing the body in a sleeplike state, the Gateway tapes
achieve the same goal as meditation in that it places the body in such a profoundly
relaxed state that the bifurcation echo slowly fades away as the heart lessens the
force and frequency with which it pushes blood into the aorta. The result is a
regular, rhythmic sinewave pattern of sound which echoes throughout the body and
rises up into the head in sustained resonance. The amplitude of this sinewave
pattern, when measured with a sensitive, seismograph type instrument is about three
times the average of the sound volume produced by the heart when it is operating
normally.

9, Brain Stimulation. Bentov's biomedical model shows that this resonance is of
considerable importance since it is directly transmitted to and impacts upon the
brain. The resulting vibration is received and transmitted into the brain itself
via the fluid filled third and left ventricles located above the brain stem. An
electromagnetic pulse is then generated which stimulates the brain to raise the
amplitude and frequency of brainwave output, just as Dr. Twemlow observed in his
research on the effects of the Hemi-Sync tapes. Also, the brain is contained in a
tight membrane called the dura which is, in turn, cushioned by a thin layer of
fluid located between it and the skull. As the coherent resonance produced by the
human heart in a state of profound relaxation reaches the fluid layer surrounding
the brain, it sets up a rhythmic pattern in which the brain moves up and down
approximately 0.005 to 0.010 millimeters in a continuous pattern. The
selfreinforcing character of resonant behavior accounts for the body's ability to
sustain this movement despite the minimal level of energy involved. In this way,
the entire body, based on its own micromotion, functions as a tuned vibrational
system which transfers energy in a range of between 6.8 and 7.5 Hertz into the
earth's ionospheric cavity, which itself resonates at about 7-7.5 Hertz. Of this
process, Bentov states:

"Dhis is occurring at a very long wavelength of about 40,000 Km, or just about
the perimeter of the planet. In other words, the signal from the movement of
our bodies will travel around the world in about one seventh of 4 second
through the electrostatic field in which we are imbedded. Such a long
wavelength knows no obstacles, and its strength does not attenuate much over
large distances. Naturally it will go through just about anything: metal,
conerete, water, and the fields making up our bodies. It is the ideal medium
for conveying a telepathic signal.”

Consequently, the Gateway process is designed to rather rapidly induce a state of
profound calm within the nervous system and to significantly lower blood pressure
to cause the circulatory system, skeleton and all other physical organ systems to
begin vibrating coherently at approximately 7-7.5 cycles per second. The resulting
resonance sets up a regular, repetitive sound wave which propagates in consonance
with the elecrostatic field of the earth.

10. Energy Entrainment. As the body is turned into a coherent oscillator
vibrating in harmony with the surrounding electrostatic medium, the specific
exercises included in the Gateway tapes enjoin the participant to build up the
energy field surrounding his body, presumably by using energy from the earth's
field which the body is now entraining because of its ability to resonate with it.
This puts the body's energy field into homogeneity with its surrounding environment
and promotes movement of the seat of consciousness into the surrounding environment
partly in response to the fact that the two electromagnetic medians are now a
single energy continuum, Thus, the same process which moves the brain into focused
