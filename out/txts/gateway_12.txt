assessment, evaluating the functioning of their thought processes against various
"objective" standards they have adopted, Human consciousness can do this because
it has the capacity to duplicate aspects of its own hologram, project them out,
"perceive" that projection, put it through comparison with the memory aspect. (where
its evaluation standards of measure are stored) of its own hologram, and measure or
tsense" the differences using three dimensional geometry ana then binary “go/no go"
pulse to yield verbal cognition about the self.

18. Time-Space Dimension. Up to this point our discussion of the Gateway process
has been relatively simple and easy to follow. Now the fun begins. Gateway
involves more than just perception of those aspects of the universal hologram which
can be accessed in the dimension of time-space as we know it, To explain how and
why human consciousness can be brought to transcend the limitations of time-space
is the next task which must be addressed, To do this we must first appreciate what
time and space are in order to understand how the dimension that they constitute
can be transcended. Physicists define time as a measurement of energy OF force in
motion. In other words, it is a measurement of change. However, in order for
energy to be in motion it must first be limited in some way within the confines of
some sort of vibratory pattern 50 that its confinement gives it the capacity for
being contained at a specific location which is distinguishable from other
locations(space). Energy which is not confined is force without limit, without
dimension, without the limits of form, It is infinity, cannot move because there
is nothing beyond infinity, and is therefore outside of the dimension of time. It
is also beyond space because that concept implies that a specific energy form is
limited to 4 specific location, and is absent from other locations. But if energy
is in the state of infinity, there are no boundaries, no "here" to differentiate
from "there", no sense of area. Energy in infinity means energy uniformly extended
without limit. It has no beginning, no end, no location. It is conscious force,
the fundamental, primal power of existence without form, a state of infinite

being. Energy in infinity is said to be completely at rest and, therefore, cannot
generate holograms so long 4s it remains utterly inactive. It retains its inherent
capacity for consciousness in that it can receive and passively perceive holograms
generated by energy in motion out in the various dimensions which make up the
created universe put it cannot be perceived by consciousness operating in the
active universe. Energy in this state of inactive infinity ig termed by physicists
as energy in its absolute state, oF simply "the Absolute." Between the Absolute
and the "material" universe in which we experience our physical existence are
various intervening dimensions to which human consciousness in altered states of
being may gain access. Theoretically, human consciousness may continue to expand
the horizons of its perceptual capability until it reaches the dimension of the
absolute at which point perception stops because the Absolute generates no
holograms of or about itself.

19, <Intervening dimensions. Since the Absolute is conscious energy in
infinity(i.e. without poundaries), it occupies every d@imension to include the
time-space dimension in which we have our physical existence but we cannot perceive
it. It overlays everything as do many of the intervening gxadients or dimensions
through which the energies of the universe pass on their way to and from their home
in the state of infinity (the Absolute). To enter these intervening dimensions,
human consciousness must focus with such intense coherence that the frequency of
the energy pattern which comprises that consciousness(i.e. the brainwave output)
can accelerate to the point where the resulting frequency pattern, if displayed on
an oscilloscope, would look virtually like a solid line. Achievement of this state
of altered consciousness sets the stage for perception of non-time-space dimensions
pecause of the operation of a principle in physics known as Planck's Distance.
